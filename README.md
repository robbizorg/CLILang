## CLILang

A simple command line application that allows you to test yourself on various
vocab words from different languages. 

### How to Run
Download the repository on your machine. Make sure that you have Java and the
Java JDK installed on your device. Type the command 'javac *.java' to 
generate all the required .class files. 

Once the class files are generated, there are two ways to run the program.
For initial users with no prior use, simply run 'java CLILang' and the program
will run. For more advanced users, it is possible to provide the program with 
a list of words and their meanings in a separate text file. Here is an example:

dictionary.txt:
>	Language:Spanish 
>	comer:to eat
>	amar:to love
>	correr:to run
Then run the command 'java CLILang dictionary.txt' and you'll be tested on
the words there!
